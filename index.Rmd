<span>Hi, and welcome to my Website!</span>

My name is Nicolai Berk, I am a PhD Candidate at the [Dynamics Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about) (which is a fancy German way to say "Grad School, but only for PhD students") and the [Chair of Comparative Politics at the Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comppol-en/team-comparative-politics).

My main interest revolves around political communication and its effects on elites' and voters' cognitive representations of politics. To study this topic, I try to combine computational text analysis and econometric tools.

Before moving to Berlin, I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Vienna and a Master of Science in Social Science from the University of Amsterdam. In Vienna, I was working as a Research Assistant to [Markus Wagner](https://staatswissenschaft.univie.ac.at/en/team/scientific-staff/markus-wagner/), mainly on the [Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES)](https://data.aussda.at/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.11587/I7QIYJ). In Amsterdam, I worked for  [Gijs Schumacher](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/s/c/g.schumacher/g.schumacher.html), mainly collecting data for [EUSpeech V2](https://osf.io/c79ha/). Gijs also invited me to the [Hot Politics Lab](http://www.hotpolitics.eu/), where I was lucky enough to [present some of my own research](https://github.com/nicolaiberk/ImEm/blob/master/08_presentation.pdf).
