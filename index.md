## Welcome to my webpage

### Bio
I am a PhD candidate at the Research Training Group "The Dynamics of Demography, Democratic Processes and Public Policy" (DYNAMICS)[https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about], jointly organised by the (Hertie School of Governance)[https://www.hertie-school.org/en/] and the (Department of Social Sciences)[https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de] at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. 

Before that I obtained my BA from the University of Vienna, where I also contributed under the guidance of (Univ.-Prof. Markus Wagner, PhD)[https://www.wagnermarkus.net/] to the Austrian election study (AUTNES)[https://autnes.at/] as a research assistant. I spent a semester at the Australian National University in Canberra and interned at the (Max-Planck Institute for the Study of Societies)[https://www.mpifg.de/] in Cologne. Funded by the (German Academic Exchange Service)[https://www.daad.de/en/], I pursued my MSc in Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam, focusing on electoral competition and automated text analysis. There, I also worked as a research assistant to (Assoc.-Prof. Dr. Gijs Schumacher)[http://www.gijsschumacher.nl/]. I also participated regularly in the (Hot Politics Lab)[http://www.hotpolitics.eu/].

I am broadly interested in questions of political competition, public opinion and political rhetoric in Western Democracies. More concretely, I combine text analysis with econometric methods to study how political parties shape the political discourse. My special interest lies in the effects of radical right rhetoric.
